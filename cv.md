### Briefly About Myself
I am a senior student of the IT Department (Computer Science and System Design) of Novosibirsk State University.

Throughout my university studies, I was looking for an area in IT where I could apply my creative skills in addition to my technical knowledge. This area was front-end development.

At the moment I would like to gain more experience in frontend development in order to create beautiful and user-friendly websites, constantly evolving in this field.

### Code Examples

Reversed Strings from CODEWARS: *Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.*
```
'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'
```
```js
function solution(str){
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}
```

Array plus array: 
*I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.*

*P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.*

```js
function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  let sum1 = arr1.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
  let sum2 = arr2.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
  return sum1 + sum2;
}
```
